     * Returns an <code>InetAddress</code> object encapsulating what is most
     * likely the machine's LAN IP address.
     * {@literal <p/>}
     * This method is intended for use as a replacement of JDK method
     * <code>InetAddress.getLocalHost</code>, because that method is ambiguous
     * on Linux systems. Linux systems enumerate the loopback network interface
     * the same way as regular LAN network interfaces, but the JDK
     * <code>InetAddress.getLocalHost</code> method does not specify the
     * algorithm used to select the address returned under such circumstances,
     * and will often return the loopback address, which is not valid for
     * network communication. Details
     * <a href="http://bugs.sun.com/bugdatabase/view_bug.do?bug_id=4665037">here</a>.
     * {@literal <p/>}
     * This method will scan all IP addresses on all network interfaces on the
     * host machine to determine the IP address most likely to be the machine's
     * LAN address. If the machine has multiple IP addresses, this method will
     * prefer a site-local IP address (e.g. 192.168.x.x or 10.10.x.x, usually
     * IPv4) if the machine has one (and will return the first site-local
     * address if the machine has more than one), but if the machine does not
     * hold a site-local address, this method will return simply the first
     * non-loopback address found (IPv4 or IPv6).
     * {@literal <p/>}
     * If this method cannot find a non-loopback address using this selection
     * algorithm, it will fall back to calling and returning the result of JDK
     * method <code>InetAddress.getLocalHost</code>.
     * {@literal <p/>}
     *
     * @throws UnknownHostException If the LAN address of the machine cannot be
     * found.
