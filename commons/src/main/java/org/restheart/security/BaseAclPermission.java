/**
 * Abstract base class representing an Access Control List (ACL) permission with conditions for request authorization.
 * 
 * <p>This class encapsulates the core components of a permission rule in RESTHeart's security framework.
 * Each permission consists of a predicate that evaluates whether a request should be allowed, a set of
 * roles that can execute the request, and a priority for ordering multiple permissions.</p>
 * 
 * <h2>Permission Model</h2>
 * <p>A permission is authorized when:</p>
 * <ol>
 *   <li>The predicate evaluates to {@code true} for the given request</li>
 *   <li>The authenticated user has at least one of the required roles (if specified)</li>
 *   <li>No higher priority permissions have denied the request</li>
 * </ol>
 * 
 * <h2>Priority System</h2>
 * <p>Permissions are evaluated in priority order (lower values = higher priority). This allows
 * for fine-grained control where specific rules can override more general ones.</p>
 * 
 * <h2>Request Attachment</h2>
 * <p>When a permission matches and allows a request, it is attached to the request's exchange
 * for downstream components to access via {@link #MATCHING_ACL_PERMISSION}.</p>
 * 
 * <h2>Example Implementation</h2>
 * <pre>{@code
 * public class CustomPermission extends BaseAclPermission {
 *     public CustomPermission() {
 *         super(
 *             request -> request.getPath().startsWith("/api"),  // predicate
 *             Set.of("user", "admin"),                         // roles
 *             100,                                              // priority
 *             Map.of("description", "API access permission")    // raw data
 *         );
 *     }
 * }
 * }</pre>
