/**
 * Interface for exchanges that buffer content in memory for efficient access and proxying.
 * <p>
 * A buffered exchange stores content in Undertow's PooledByteBuffer system, which provides
 * efficient memory management for request/response content. This buffering mechanism enables
 * content to be read multiple times and supports proxying scenarios where content needs to
 * be forwarded to backend services.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The buffering approach is particularly useful for:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Proxied requests where content must be forwarded to another service</li>
 *   <li>Content transformation scenarios requiring multiple passes over the data</li>
 *   <li>Logging or auditing where raw content access is needed</li>
 *   <li>Error handling where original content may need to be preserved</li>
 * </ul>
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Implementations must handle the conversion between the generic type T and the underlying
 * byte buffer representation, ensuring proper encoding/decoding and resource management.
 * </p>
