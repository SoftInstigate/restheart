/**
 * ServiceRequest implementation that handles plain text content as strings.
 * <p>
 * This class provides specialized handling for HTTP requests containing plain text
 * content, extending ServiceRequest to offer efficient string parsing and handling
 * capabilities. It reads the raw request body and converts it directly to a String
 * using the appropriate character encoding.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * StringRequest is commonly used by services that need to process:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Plain text content submissions</li>
 *   <li>Raw data that doesn't require structured parsing</li>
 *   <li>Template content or configuration data</li>
 *   <li>Log entries or message content</li>
 *   <li>Custom protocol payloads in text format</li>
 * </ul>
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Key features:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Efficient string reading from HTTP request streams</li>
 *   <li>Automatic handling of Content-Length for proper data reading</li>
 *   <li>UTF-8 character encoding support</li>
 *   <li>Memory-efficient processing for text content</li>
 * </ul>
 * </p>
