/**
 * Exception thrown when a requested query operation cannot be found or executed.
 * <p>
 * This exception is used throughout the RESTHeart framework to signal that
 * a specific query, aggregation, or database operation that was requested
 * cannot be located or executed. This typically occurs when referencing
 * predefined queries, aggregations, or operations that don't exist in the
 * current configuration.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Common scenarios where this exception is thrown include:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Attempting to execute a predefined aggregation that doesn't exist</li>
 *   <li>Referencing a named query that hasn't been configured</li>
 *   <li>Trying to access a parameterized operation that's not available</li>
 *   <li>Requesting a stored procedure or function that cannot be found</li>
 *   <li>Accessing collection-specific operations that are not defined</li>
 * </ul>
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * This is a checked exception that requires explicit handling by callers,
 * ensuring that missing query operations are properly caught and converted
 * to appropriate HTTP error responses for clients. The exception typically
 * results in a 404 Not Found response when thrown during query processing.
 * </p>
