/**
 * Base class for Response implementations that support content buffering for proxy operations.
 * <p>
 * This abstract class extends Response and implements BufferedExchange to provide specialized
 * functionality for responses that need to be processed in proxy scenarios. It manages content
 * buffering using Undertow's PooledByteBuffer system, allowing response content to be read
 * multiple times, transformed, or forwarded to different destinations.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * ProxyResponse is essential for scenarios where:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Response content needs to be inspected before forwarding to clients</li>
 *   <li>Content transformation is required during proxying</li>
 *   <li>Response validation must occur before client delivery</li>
 *   <li>Logging or auditing of response content is needed</li>
 *   <li>Error responses need to be generated with specific content types</li>
 * </ul>
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The class stores buffered content in the BUFFERED_RESPONSE_DATA_KEY attachment of the
 * HttpServerExchange, ensuring proper integration with Undertow's response processing
 * pipeline. It also implements AutoCloseable to ensure proper cleanup of buffer
 * resources and prevent memory leaks.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Subclasses must implement {@link #readContent()}, {@link #writeContent(Object)}, and
 * {@link #getErrorContent(int, String, String, Throwable, boolean)} to handle the specific
 * content type conversion and error response formatting.
 * </p>
 *
 * @author Andrea Di Cesare {@literal <andrea@softinstigate.com>}
 * @param <T> the type of content handled by this proxy response (e.g., String, JsonElement, byte[])
