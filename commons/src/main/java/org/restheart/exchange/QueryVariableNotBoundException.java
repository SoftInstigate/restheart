/**
 * Exception thrown when a query or aggregation variable is referenced but not bound to a value.
 * <p>
 * This exception is used throughout the RESTHeart framework to signal that
 * a parameterized query, aggregation, or database operation contains variable
 * references that have not been provided with actual values. This typically
 * occurs when executing predefined queries or aggregations that expect
 * parameter substitution but the required variables are missing.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Common scenarios where this exception is thrown include:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Executing a parameterized aggregation pipeline without providing required variables</li>
 *   <li>Running a predefined query that expects path or query parameter substitution</li>
 *   <li>Processing template-based operations with missing variable bindings</li>
 *   <li>Attempting to resolve placeholder values that haven't been defined</li>
 *   <li>Using MongoDB aggregation variables (avars) that are not bound in the request</li>
 * </ul>
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * This is a checked exception that requires explicit handling by callers,
 * ensuring that unbound variables are properly caught and converted to
 * appropriate HTTP error responses for clients. The exception typically
 * results in a 400 Bad Request response when thrown during query processing.
 * </p>
