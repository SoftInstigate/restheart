/**
 * Specialized Interceptor interface for proxy requests and responses.
 * 
 * This interface provides a type-safe way to intercept requests and responses
 * that are being proxied to external services through RESTHeart. It extends
 * the generic Interceptor interface with specific parameterization for
 * ByteArrayProxyRequest and ByteArrayProxyResponse types.
 * 
 * Interceptors implementing this interface can process requests before they
 * are forwarded to the target service and responses before they are sent
 * back to the client. This is useful for adding headers, logging, authentication,
 * content transformation, or other cross-cutting concerns for proxied requests.
