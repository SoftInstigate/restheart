/**
 * Specialized Interceptor interface for services implementing StringService.
 * 
 * This interface provides a type-safe way to intercept string-based requests and responses
 * in the RESTHeart framework. It extends the generic Interceptor interface with specific
 * parameterization for StringRequest and StringResponse types.
 * 
 * Interceptors implementing this interface can process string content before it is
 * handled by the service or before the response is sent back to the client.
 * This is particularly useful for text processing, content validation, transformation,
 * logging, or applying business rules to string-based payloads.
