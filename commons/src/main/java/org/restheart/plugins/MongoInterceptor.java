/**
 * Specialized Interceptor interface for MongoService.
 * 
 * This interface provides a type-safe way to intercept MongoDB-related requests and responses
 * in the RESTHeart framework. It extends the generic Interceptor interface with specific
 * parameterization for MongoRequest and MongoResponse types.
 * 
 * Interceptors implementing this interface can process MongoDB operations before they are
 * handled by the MongoService or before the response is sent back to the client. This
 * enables custom validation, transformation, logging, security checks, or other
 * cross-cutting concerns specific to MongoDB operations.
