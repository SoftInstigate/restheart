/**
 * Specialized Interceptor interface for services implementing BsonService.
 * 
 * This interface provides a type-safe way to intercept BSON-based requests and responses
 * in the RESTHeart framework. It extends the generic Interceptor interface with specific
 * parameterization for BsonRequest and BsonResponse types.
 * 
 * Interceptors implementing this interface can process BSON documents before they are
 * handled by the service or before the response is sent back to the client.
