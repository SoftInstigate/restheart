/**
 * Central registry for all RESTHeart plugins including services, interceptors,

 * - Authorization components (authorizers and permission transformers)
 * - Services and their interceptors
 * - Initializers and providers
 * - Pipeline handlers and routing information
 * 
 * The registry also manages the root path handler and provides methods to
