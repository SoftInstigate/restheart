/**
 * Enumeration defining the intercept points where interceptors can be executed in the request processing pipeline.
 * <p>
 * InterceptPoint determines when an interceptor is invoked during the lifecycle of an HTTP request
 * in RESTHeart. Each intercept point provides access to different aspects of the request and response,
 * allowing interceptors to perform various types of processing at the most appropriate time.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The request processing pipeline follows this order:
 * <ol>
 *   <li>{@link #REQUEST_BEFORE_EXCHANGE_INIT} - Before request/response objects are created</li>
 *   <li>{@link #REQUEST_BEFORE_AUTH} - After initialization but before authentication</li>
 *   <li>{@link #REQUEST_AFTER_AUTH} - After authentication but before request handling</li>
 *   <li>Request handling by service or proxy</li>
 *   <li>{@link #RESPONSE} - After response generation (blocking)</li>
 *   <li>{@link #RESPONSE_ASYNC} - After response generation (asynchronous)</li>
 * </ol>
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Each intercept point serves different use cases:
 * <ul>
 *   <li><strong>Security</strong> - Authentication and authorization checks</li>
 *   <li><strong>Logging</strong> - Request/response logging and monitoring</li>
 *   <li><strong>Content Transformation</strong> - Modifying request or response data</li>
 *   <li><strong>Validation</strong> - Input validation and constraint checking</li>
 *   <li><strong>Caching</strong> - Response caching and cache invalidation</li>
 * </ul>
 * </p>
