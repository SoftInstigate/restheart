/**

 *
 * when multiple AuthenticatorMechanism are defined, the standard undertow
 * authentication process is:
 *
 * As an in-bound request is received the authenticate method is called on each
 * mechanism in turn until one of the following occurs: <br>
 * - A mechanism successfully authenticates the incoming request. <br>
 * - A mechanism attempts but fails to authenticate the request. <br>
 * - The list of mechanisms is exhausted.
