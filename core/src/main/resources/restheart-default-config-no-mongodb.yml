  # Use mongo-mounts to expose MongoDb resources binding them to API URIs.
  #
  # The parameter 'what' identifies the MongoDb resource to expose.
  # The format is /db[/coll[/docid]]
  # Use the wildcard '*' to expose all dbs.
  #
  # The parameter 'where' defines the URI to bind the resource to.
  # It can be an absolute path (eg. /api) or path template (eg. /{foo}/bar/*).
  # The values of the path templates properties are available:
  # - in the 'what' property (e.g. what: /{foo}_db/coll)
  # - programmatically from MongoRequest.getPathTemplateParamenters() method.
  #
  # It is not possible to mix absolute paths and path templates: 'where' URIs
  # need to be either all absolute paths or all path templates.
  #
  # Examples:
  # The following exposes all MongoDb resources.
  # In this case the URI of a document is /db/coll/docid
  #
  #   - what: "*"
  #     where: /
  #
  # The following binds the URI /database to the db 'db'
  # In this case the URI of a document is /database/coll/docid
  #
  #   - what: /db
  #     where: /database
  #
  # The following binds the URI /api to the collection 'db.coll'
  # In this case the URI of a document is /api/docid
  #
  #   - what: /db/coll
  #     where: /api
