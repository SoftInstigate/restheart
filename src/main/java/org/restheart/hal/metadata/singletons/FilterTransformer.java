 * This transformer filters out the properties from the resource representation.
 * the properties to filter out are passed in the args argumenet as an array of
 * strings.
 *
 * If added to the REQUEST phase, it avoids properties to be stored, if added to
 * the RESPONSE phase, it hides stored properties.
 *
 * <br>Example that removes the property 'password' from the response:
 * <br>rtl:=[{name:"filterProperties", "phase":"RESPONSE", "scope":"CHILDREN",
 * args:["password"]}]
