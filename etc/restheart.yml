## RESTHeart configuration file.
---
#### listeners

# Listeners allow to specify the protocol, ip, port and to use.
# The supported protocols are: http, https and ajp. You can setup a listener per protocol (up to 3).

# WARNING: RESTHeart uses basic authentication; usernames and passwords are sent over the net on each request.
# Using the http listener is not secure: users credentials can be sniffed by a man-in-the-middle attack.
# Use the http listener only on trusted environments.

https-listener: true
https-host: 0.0.0.0
https-port: 4443

http-listener: true
http-host: 0.0.0.0
http-port: 8080

ajp-listener: false
ajp-host: 0.0.0.0
ajp-port: 8009

#### SSL configuration

# Configure the keystore to enable the https listener.

# RESTHeart comes with a self-signed certificate that makes straightforward enabling https.
# Specify use-embedded-keystore: true to use it (this is the default setting).
# Using the self-signed certificate leads to issues with some clients; 
# for instance, with curl you need to specify the "--insecure" option or you'll get an error message.

use-embedded-keystore: true

# To use your own certificate you need to import it (and eventually the CA certificates chain) into a java keystore
# and speficy use-embedded-keystore: false and the keystore-file,keystore-password and certpassword configuration properties. 
# Refer to the java keystore documentation for that.

#keystore-file: /path/to/keystore/file
#keystore-password: password
#certpassword: password

#### mongodb 

# Secify the ip and port of mongodb with mongo-servers. For mongodb replica set, specify all your servers.

mongo-servers:
    - host: 127.0.0.1
      port: 27017
      
# Provide mongodb users credentials with mongo-credentials.
#mongo-credentials:
#    - auth-db: admin
#      user: admin
#      password: adminadmin
      
# Use mongo-mounts to bind URls to mongodb resources using the out-of-the-box URL rewrite feature.
mongo-mounts:
    - what: "*"
      where: /
      
#### static web resources

# static web resources to bind to the specified URL.
# the 'what' property is the path of the directory containing the resources. 
# the path is either absolute (starting with /) or relative to the restheart.jar directory
# if embedded is true, the resources are either included in the restheart.jar or in the classpath

static-resources-mounts:
    - what: browser
      where: /browser
      welcome-file: browser.html
      secured: false
      embedded: true

#### application logic

# RESTHeart has a pipeline architecture where specialized undertow handlers are chained to serve the requests.
# In order to provide additional application logic, custom hanlders pipes can be bound under the /_logic URL.
# The custom hanlder must extends the org.restheart.handlers.ApplicationLogicHandler class
# Use application-logic-mounts to configure custom handlers.

# In the following example two built-in application logic handlers are defined:
# PingHandler bound to /_logic/ping that implements a simple ping service
# GetRoleHandler bound to /_logic/roles that returns the current user authentication status and eventually its roles

application-logic-mounts:
    - what: org.restheart.handlers.applicationlogic.PingHandler
      where: /ping
      secured: false
      args:
          msg: "greetings from the restheart team"
    - what: org.restheart.handlers.applicationlogic.GetRoleHandler
      where: /roles
      secured: false
      args:
          url: /_logic/roles

### metadata named singletons

# metadata implementation can rely on singletons, this section configures the
# singleton factory #org.restheart.hal.metadata.singletons.NamedSingletonsFactory

### security 

# The security is configured by setting:

# idm: the Identity Manager responsible of authentication
# access-manager: the Access Manager responsible of authorization
# The RESTHeart security is pluggable and you can provide you own implementation of both IDM and AM.
# the provided default implementations of IDM and AM are SimpleFileIdentityManager, DbIdentityManager and SimpleAccessManager.
# conf-file paths are either absolute (starting with /) or relative to the restheart.jar file path

idm:    
    implementation-class: org.restheart.security.impl.SimpleFileIdentityManager
    conf-file: ./etc/security.yml
access-manager:    
    implementation-class: org.restheart.security.impl.SimpleAccessManager
    conf-file: ./etc/security.yml

# authentication token

# note: you need to pay attention to the authentitcation token in case of multi-node deployments (horizontal scalability).
# in this case, you need to either disable it or use a load balancer with the sticky session option 
# or use a distributed auth token cache implementation (not provided in the current version).

auth-token-enabled: true
auth-token-ttl: 15
    
#### logging

# enable-log-console: true => log messages to the console (default value: true)
# enable-log-file: true => log messages to a file (default value: true)
# log-file-path: to specify the log file path (default value: restheart.log in system temporary directory)
# log-level: to set the log level. Value can be OFF, ERROR, WARN, INFO, DEBUG, TRACE and ALL. (default value is INFO)

enable-log-file: false
#log-file-path: /tmp/restheart.log
enable-log-console: true
log-level: INFO

#### performace settings

## eager db cursor preallocation policy
# in big collections, reading a far page involves skipping the db cursor for many documents resulting in a performance bottleneck
# for instance, with default pagesize of 100, a GET with page=50.000 involves 500.000 skips on the db cursor.
# the eager db cursor preallocation engine boosts up performaces (in some use cases, up to 1000%). the following options control its behavior.

eager-cursor-allocation-pool-size: 100

eager-cursor-allocation-linear-slice-width: 1000
eager-cursor-allocation-linear-slice-delta: 100
eager-cursor-allocation-linear-slice-heights: [ 4, 2, 1 ]
eager-cursor-allocation-random-max-cursors: 20
eager-cursor-allocation-random-slice-min-width: 1000

# In order to save bandwitdth RESTHeart can force requests to support the giz encoding (if not, requests will be rejected)
force-gzip-encoding: false

# local-cache allows to cache the db and collection properties to drammatically improve performaces. 
# Without caching, a GET on a document would requires two additional queries to retrieve the db and the collection properties.
# pay attention to local caching only in case of multi-node deployments (horizontal scalability). 
# In this case a change in a db or collection properties would reflect on other nodes at worst after the TTL (cache entries time to live). 
# In most of the cases Dbs and collections properties only change at development time.

local-cache-enabled: true
# TTL in milliseconds; specify a value < 0 to never expire cached entries 
local-cache-ttl: 1000

# to set a limit for the maximum number of concurrent requests being served
requests-limit: 1000

# the number of I/O threads created for non-blocking tasks. at least 2. suggested value: core*2
io-threads: 2 

# the number of threads created for blocking tasks (such as ones involving db access). suggested value: core*16
worker-threads: 8 

# use 16k buffers for best performance - as in linux 16k is generally the default amount of data that can be sent in a single write() call
buffer-size: 16384
buffers-per-region: 20
# should the buffer pool use direct buffers, this instructs the JVM to use native (if possible) I/O operations on the buffers
