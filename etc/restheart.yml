## RESTHeart Configuration File.
---
#### Listeners

# Listeners allow to specify the protocol, ip, port and to use.
# The supported protocols are: http, https and ajp. You can setup a listener per protocol (up to 3).

# WARNING: RESTHeart uses basic authentication; usernames and passwords are sent over the net on each request.
# Using the http listener is not secure: users credentials can be sniffed by a man-in-the-middle attack.
# Use the http listener only on trusted environments.

https-listener: true
https-host: 0.0.0.0
https-port: 4443

http-listener: true
http-host: 0.0.0.0
http-port: 8080

ajp-listener: false
ajp-host: 0.0.0.0
ajp-port: 8009

#### SSL Configuration

# Configure the keystore to enable the https listener.

# RESTHeart comes with a self-signed certificate that makes straightforward enabling https.
# Specify use-embedded-keystore: true to use it (this is the default setting).
# Using the self-signed certificate leads to issues with some clients;
# for instance, with curl you need to specify the "--insecure" option or you'll get an error message.

use-embedded-keystore: true

# To use your own certificate you need to import it (and eventually the CA certificates chain) into a java keystore
# and specify use-embedded-keystore: false and the keystore-file,keystore-password and certpassword configuration properties.
# Refer to the java keystore documentation for that.

#keystore-file: /path/to/keystore/file
#keystore-password: password
#certpassword: password

#### MongoDB

# Specify the mongodb connection using a Mongo Client URI.
# The format of the URI is:
#    mongodb://[username:password@]host1[:port1][,host2[:port2],...[,hostN[:portN]]][/[database][?options]]
#
# The URI option authSource allows to specify the authetication database, example:
# mongodb://user:secret@127.0.0.1/?authSource=authdb
#
# More information at http://api.mongodb.org/java/current/com/mongodb/MongoClientURI.html

mongo-uri: mongodb://127.0.0.1

# Use mongo-mounts to bind URls to mongodb resources using the out-of-the-box URL rewrite feature.
mongo-mounts:
    - what: "*"
      where: /

#### Static Web Resources

# Static web resources to bind to the specified URL.
# The 'what' property is the path of the directory containing the resources.
# The path is either absolute (starting with /) or relative to the restheart.jar directory
# If embedded is true, the resources are either included in the restheart.jar or in the classpath

static-resources-mounts:
    - what: browser
      where: /browser
      welcome-file: browser.html
      secured: false
      embedded: true

#### Application Logic

# RESTHeart has a pipeline architecture where specialized undertow handlers are chained to serve the requests.
# In order to provide additional application logic, custom hanlders pipes can be bound under the /_logic URL.
# The custom hanlder must extends the org.restheart.handlers.ApplicationLogicHandler class
# Use application-logic-mounts to configure custom handlers.

# In the following example two built-in application logic handlers are defined:
# PingHandler bound to /_logic/ping that implements a simple ping service
# GetRoleHandler bound to /_logic/roles that returns the current user authentication status and eventually its roles
# CacheInvalidator bound to /_logic/ic that invalidates a db or collection cache entry

application-logic-mounts:
    - what: org.restheart.handlers.applicationlogic.PingHandler
      where: /ping
      secured: false
      args:
          msg: "ciao from the restheart team"
    - what: org.restheart.handlers.applicationlogic.GetRoleHandler
      where: /roles
      secured: false
      args:
          url: /_logic/roles
    - what: org.restheart.handlers.applicationlogic.CacheInvalidator
      where: /ic
      secured: true

### Metadata Named Singletons

# Metadata implementation can rely on singletons, this section configures the
# singleton factory #org.restheart.hal.metadata.singletons.NamedSingletonsFactory

metadata-named-singletons:
    # Checkers group used by handler:
    # org.restheart.handlers.metadata.CheckMetadataHandler
    # More information in checkers javadoc
    - group: checkers
      interface: org.restheart.hal.metadata.singletons.Checker
      singletons:

### Security

# The security is configured by setting:

# idm: the Identity Manager responsible of authentication
# access-manager: the Access Manager responsible of authorization
# The RESTHeart security is pluggable and you can provide you own implementation of both IDM and AM.
# The provided default implementations of IDM and AM are SimpleFileIdentityManager, DbIdentityManager and SimpleAccessManager.
# conf-file paths are either absolute (starting with /) or relative to the restheart.jar file path

idm:
    implementation-class: org.restheart.security.impl.SimpleFileIdentityManager
    conf-file: ./etc/security.yml
access-manager:
    implementation-class: org.restheart.security.impl.SimpleAccessManager
    conf-file: ./etc/security.yml

# Authentication Token

# Note: you need to pay attention to the authentitcation token in case of multi-node deployments (horizontal scalability).
# In this case, you need to either disable it or use a load balancer with the sticky session option
# or use a distributed auth token cache implementation (not provided in the current version).

auth-token-enabled: true
auth-token-ttl: 15

#### Logging

# enable-log-console: true => log messages to the console (default value: true)
# enable-log-file: true => log messages to a file (default value: true)
# log-file-path: to specify the log file path (default value: restheart.log in system temporary directory)
# log-level: to set the log level. Value can be OFF, ERROR, WARN, INFO, DEBUG, TRACE and ALL. (default value is INFO)

enable-log-file: false
#log-file-path: /tmp/restheart.log
enable-log-console: true
log-level: INFO

#### Performace Settings

## Eager DB Cursor Preallocation Policy
# In big collections, reading a far page involves skipping the db cursor for many documents resulting in a performance bottleneck
# For instance, with default pagesize of 100, a GET with page=50.000 involves 500.000 skips on the db cursor.
# The eager db cursor preallocation engine boosts up performaces (in some use cases, up to 1000%). the following options control its behavior.

eager-cursor-allocation-pool-size: 100

eager-cursor-allocation-linear-slice-width: 1000
eager-cursor-allocation-linear-slice-delta: 100
eager-cursor-allocation-linear-slice-heights: [ 4, 2, 1 ]
eager-cursor-allocation-random-max-cursors: 20
eager-cursor-allocation-random-slice-min-width: 1000

# In order to save bandwitdth RESTHeart can force requests to support the giz encoding (if not, requests will be rejected)
force-gzip-encoding: false

# local-cache allows to cache the db and collection properties to drammatically improve performaces.
# Without caching, a GET on a document would requires two additional queries to retrieve the db and the collection properties.
# Pay attention to local caching only in case of multi-node deployments (horizontal scalability).
# In this case a change in a db or collection properties would reflect on other nodes at worst after the TTL (cache entries time to live).
# In most of the cases Dbs and collections properties only change at development time.

local-cache-enabled: true
# TTL in milliseconds; specify a value < 0 to never expire cached entries
local-cache-ttl: 1000

# Limit for the maximum number of concurrent requests being served
requests-limit: 1000

# Number of I/O threads created for non-blocking tasks. at least 2. suggested value: core*2
io-threads: 2

# Number of threads created for blocking tasks (such as ones involving db access). suggested value: core*16
worker-threads: 8

# Use 16k buffers for best performance - as in linux 16k is generally the default amount of data that can be sent in a single write() call
buffer-size: 16384
buffers-per-region: 20
# Should the buffer pool use direct buffers, this instructs the JVM to use native (if possible) I/O operations on the buffers
direct-buffers: true
