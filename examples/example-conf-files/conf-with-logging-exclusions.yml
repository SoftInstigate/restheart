  # NEW: Request path patterns to exclude from logging
  # This helps reduce log noise from health checks and monitoring endpoints
  requests-log-exclude-patterns:
    - "/ping"              # Exact match for load balancer health checks
    - "/health"            # Exact match for health endpoint
    - "/_ping"             # Exact match for internal ping
    - "/monitoring/*"      # Wildcard: excludes all paths starting with /monitoring/
    - "/api/*/status"      # Wildcard: excludes /api/v1/status, /api/v2/status, etc.
