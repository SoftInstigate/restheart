## RESTHeart Configuration File.
---
#### Listeners

# Listeners allow to specify the protocol, ip, port and to use.
# The supported protocols are: http, https and ajp. You can setup a listener per protocol (up to 3).

# WARNING: RESTHeart uses basic authentication; usernames and passwords are sent over the net on each request.
# Using the http listener is not secure: users credentials can be sniffed by a man-in-the-middle attack.
# Use the http listener only on trusted environments.

https-listener: true
https-host: 0.0.0.0
https-port: 4443

http-listener: true
http-host: 0.0.0.0
http-port: 8080

ajp-listener: false
ajp-host: 0.0.0.0
ajp-port: 8009

#### Instance name

# The name of this restheart instance. displayed in log, also allows to implement instance specific custom code
# For instance, an email notifier hook can send emails to a test email address in development environments

instance-name: restheart-docker

#### default representation format (PLAIN_JSON or HAL)

default-representation-format: PLAIN_JSON

#### use Ansi console for logging. Default to 'true' if parameter missing, for backward compatibility

ansi-console: true

#### Allow unescaped characters in URL
# Starting with Undertow 1.4.23 URLs validation became much stricter.
# However, this is breaking existing clients. Now you can decide which behaviour you prefer

allow-unescaped-characters-in-url: true

#### SSL Configuration

# Configure the keystore to enable the https listener.

# RESTHeart comes with a self-signed certificate that makes straightforward enabling https.
# Specify use-embedded-keystore: true to use it (this is the default setting).
# Using the self-signed certificate leads to issues with some clients;
# for instance, with curl you need to specify the "--insecure" option or you'll get an error message.

use-embedded-keystore: true

# To use your own certificate you need to import it (and eventually the CA certificates chain) into a java keystore
# and specify use-embedded-keystore: false and the keystore-file,keystore-password and certpassword configuration properties.
# Refer to the java keystore documentation for that.

#keystore-file: /path/to/keystore/file
#keystore-password: password
#certpassword: password

#### MongoDB

# Specify the mongodb connection using a Mongo Client URI.
# The format of the URI is:
#    mongodb://[username:password@]host1[:port1][,host2[:port2],...[,hostN[:portN]]][/[database][?options]]
#
# The URI option authSource allows to specify the authetication database, example:
# mongodb://user:secret@127.0.0.1/?authSource=authdb
#
# More information at http://api.mongodb.org/java/current/com/mongodb/MongoClientURI.html
# Be sure that the following credentials match with the 
# MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_USERNAME and MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_PASSWORD in docker-compose.yml
# WARNING: change in both files the below default credentials!
mongo-uri: mongodb://mongodb

# Use mongo-mounts to bind URls to mongodb resources using the out-of-the-box URL rewrite feature.
# The where URI can be an absolute path (eg. /api) or path template (eg. /{foo}/bar/*). 
# The values of the path templates properties are available:
# - in the what property (e.g. what: /{foo}_db/coll) 
# - programmatically from RequestContext.getPathTemplateParamenters() method.
# It is not possible to mix absolute paths and path templates: where URIs need to be 
# either all absolute paths or all path templates.
mongo-mounts:
    - what: "*"
      where: /
    - what: "*"
      where: /remappedall
    - what: /testdb
      where: /remappeddb
    - what: /testdb/refcoll1
      where: /remappedrefcoll1
    - what: /testdb/refcoll2
      where: /remappedrefcoll2
    - what: /testdb/refcoll1/doc1
      where: /remappeddoc1
    - what: /testdb/refcoll2/doc2
      where: /remappeddoc2

#### Static Web Resources

# Static web resources to bind to the specified URL.
# The 'what' property is the path of the directory containing the resources.
# The path is either absolute (starting with /) or relative to the restheart.jar directory
# If embedded is true, the resources are either included in the restheart.jar or in the classpath

static-resources-mounts:
    - what: browser
      where: /browser
      welcome-file: browser.html
      secured: false
      embedded: true

### Initializer

# A custom initializer implmenting the org.restheart.init.Initializer interface
# Can be used to inizialize data or add global transformers, checkers or security predicates
# See org.restheart.init.TestInitializer for a simple example

#initializer-class: org.restheart.init.TestInitializer

#### Application Logic

# RESTHeart has a pipeline architecture where specialized undertow handlers are chained to serve the requests.
# In order to provide additional application logic, custom hanlders pipes can be bound under the /_logic URL.
# The custom hanlder must extends the org.restheart.handlers.ApplicationLogicHandler class
# Use application-logic-mounts to configure custom handlers.

# In the following example two built-in application logic handlers are defined:
# PingHandler bound to /_logic/ping that implements a simple ping service
# GetRoleHandler bound to /_logic/roles that returns the current user authentication status and eventually its roles
# CacheInvalidator bound to /_logic/ic that invalidates a db or collection cache entry

application-logic-mounts:
    - what: org.restheart.handlers.applicationlogic.PingHandler
      where: /ping
      secured: false
      args:
          msg: "ciao from the restheart team"
    - what: org.restheart.handlers.applicationlogic.GetRoleHandler
      where: /roles
      secured: false
      args:
          url: /_logic/roles
    - what: org.restheart.handlers.applicationlogic.CacheInvalidator
      where: /ic
      secured: true
    - what: org.restheart.handlers.applicationlogic.CsvLoaderHandler
      where: /csv
      secured: true

### Security

# The security is configured by setting:

# idm: the Identity Manager responsible of authentication
# access-manager: the Access Manager responsible of authorization
# auth-mechanism: the additional Authentication Mechanism to use 
# The RESTHeart security is pluggable and you can provide you own 
# implementation of both IDM and AM. the provided default 
# implementations of IDM and AM are SimpleFileIdentityManager, 
# DbIdentityManager, JwtIdentityManager and SimpleAccessManager.
# conf-file paths are either absolute (starting with /) 
# or relative to the restheart.jar directory

#idm:
#    implementation-class: org.restheart.security.impl.SimpleFileIdentityManager
#    conf-file: ./etc/security.yml
#access-manager:
#    implementation-class: org.restheart.security.impl.SimpleAccessManager
#    conf-file: ./etc/security.yml
    
# RESTHeart uses the BasicAuthenticationMechanism by default. 
# A different mechanism can be specified via the auth-mechanism configuration option
# the implementation-class must specify a factory class implementing
# the interface org.restheart.security.AuthenticationMechanismFactory
# See http://undertow.io/undertow-docs/undertow-docs-2.0.0/index.html#security 
# JwtAuthenticationManagerFactory and IdentityAuthenticationManagerFactory 
# for example implementations

# Identity Authentication Manager 
# All requests are bound to the specified user

#auth-mechanism:
#    implementation-class: org.restheart.security.impl.IdentityAuthenticationManagerFactory
#    username: a
#    pwd: a

# Jwt Authentication Manager 
# Authentication via Json Web Token https://jwt.io

# algorithm: RSA (RS256 | RS384 |RS512) or HMAC (HS256 | HS384 | HS512)
# key: for RSA the base64 encoded of the public key; for HMAC, the secret key
# base64Encoded: set to true if the jwt token is base64 encoded. optional, default valud: false
# usernameClaim: the claim that holds the username. optional, default value: 'sub' (jwt subject). 
# rolesClaim: the claim that holds the roles as string or array of strings
# issuer: verify the issues (iss claim). optional, default value matches: null (don't check iss)
# audience: verify the audience (aud claim). optional, default value matches: null (don't check aud)

#auth-mechanism:
#    implementation-class: org.restheart.security.impl.JwtAuthenticationManagerFactory
#    algorithm: HS256
#    key: secret
#    base64Encoded: false
#    usernameClaim: sub
#    rolesClaim: roles
#    issuer: myIssuer
#    audience: myAudience

# Authentication Token

# Note: you need to pay attention to the authentitcation token in case of multi-node deployments (horizontal scalability).
# In this case, you need to either disable it or use a load balancer with the sticky session option
# or use a distributed auth token cache implementation (not provided in the current version).

auth-token-enabled: false
auth-token-ttl: 15

# Check if aggregation variables use operators. allowing operators in aggregation variables 
# is risky. requester can inject operators modifying the query
aggregation-check-operators: true

#### Logging

# enable-log-console: true => log messages to the console (default value: true)
# enable-log-file: true => log messages to a file (default value: true)
# log-file-path: to specify the log file path (default value: restheart.log in system temporary directory)
# log-level: to set the log level. Value can be OFF, ERROR, WARN, INFO, DEBUG, TRACE and ALL. (default value is INFO)
# requests-log-level: log the request-response. 0 => no log, 1 => light log, 2 => detailed dump
# requests-log-trace-headers: add the HTTP headers you want to be put on the MDC for logback. Use with %X{header-name} in logback.xml.
#                             Useful for tracing support in the logs. Leave empty to deactivate this feature.
# metrics-gathering-level: metrics gathering for which level? OFF => no gathering, ROOT => gathering at root level,
#                          DATABASE => at db level, COLLECTION => at collection level
# WARNING: use requests-log-level level 2 only for development purposes, it logs user credentials (Authorization and Auth-Token headers)

enable-log-file: true

#### ETag policy

# the following configuration defines the default etag check policy
# the policy applies for dbs, collections (also applies to file buckets) and documents
# valid values are REQUIRED, REQUIRED_FOR_DELETE, OPTIONAL

etag-check-policy:
    db: REQUIRED_FOR_DELETE
    coll: REQUIRED_FOR_DELETE
    doc: OPTIONAL

#### Performace Settings

## Read Performance

# default-pagesize is the number of documents returned when the pagesize query 
# parameter is not specified
# see https://restheart.org/learn/query-documents/#paging
default-pagesize: 100

# max-pagesize sets the maximum allowed value of the pagesize query parameter
# generally, the greater the pagesize, the more json serializan overhead occurs
# the rule of thumb is not exeeding 1000
max-pagesize: 1000

# cursor-batch-size sets the mongodb cursor batchSize
# see https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/method/cursor.batchSize/
# cursor-batch-size should be smaller or equal to the max-pagesize
# the rule of thumb is setting cursor-batch-size equal to max-pagesize
# a small cursor-batch-size (e.g. 101, the default mongodb batchSize)
# speeds up requests with small pagesize
cursor-batch-size: 1000

## Eager DB Cursor Preallocation Policy
# In big collections, reading a far page involves skipping the db cursor for many documents resulting in a performance bottleneck
# For instance, with default pagesize of 100, a GET with page=50.000 involves 500.000 skips on the db cursor.
# The eager db cursor preallocation engine boosts up performaces (in some use cases, up to 1000%). the following options control its behavior.

eager-cursor-allocation-pool-size: 100

eager-cursor-allocation-linear-slice-width: 1000
eager-cursor-allocation-linear-slice-delta: 100
eager-cursor-allocation-linear-slice-heights: [ 4, 2, 1 ]
eager-cursor-allocation-random-max-cursors: 20
eager-cursor-allocation-random-slice-min-width: 1000

# In order to save bandwitdth RESTHeart can force requests to support the giz encoding (if not, requests will be rejected)
force-gzip-encoding: false

# local-cache allows to cache the db and collection properties to drammatically improve performaces.
# Without caching, a GET on a document would requires two additional queries to retrieve the db and the collection properties.
# Pay attention to local caching only in case of multi-node deployments (horizontal scalability).
# In this case a change in a db or collection properties would reflect on other nodes at worst after the TTL (cache entries time to live).
# In most of the cases Dbs and collections properties only change at development time.

local-cache-enabled: true
# TTL in milliseconds; specify a value < 0 to never expire cached entries
local-cache-ttl: 1000

schema-cache-enabled: true
# TTL in milliseconds; specify a value < 0 to never expire cached entries
schema-cache-ttl: 60000

# Limit for the maximum number of concurrent requests being served
requests-limit: 1000

# Time limit in milliseconds for processing queries on the server (without network latency). 0 means no time limit
query-time-limit: 0

# Time limit in milliseconds for processing aggregations on the server (without network latency). 0 means no time limit
aggregation-time-limit: 0

# Number of I/O threads created for non-blocking tasks. at least 2. suggested value: core*2
io-threads: 2

# Number of threads created for blocking tasks (such as ones involving db access). suggested value: core*16
worker-threads: 8

# Use 16k buffers for best performance - as in linux 16k is generally the default amount of data that can be sent in a single write() call
buffer-size: 16384
buffers-per-region: 20
# Should the buffer pool use direct buffers, this instructs the JVM to use native (if possible) I/O operations on the buffers
direct-buffers: true

#### Connetction Options

     # If this is not specified it will be the same as MAX_ENTITY_SIZE
    MULTIPART_MAX_ENTITY_SIZE: -1
    
    # The idle timeout in milliseconds after which the channel will be closed.
    # If the underlying channel already has a read or write timeout set

    # before it is closed;
    # Defaults to unlimited (-1).
    NO_REQUEST_TIMEOUT: -1

    # The maximum number of query parameters that are permitted in a request. 
    # If a client sends more than this number the connection will be closed. 
    # This limit is necessary to protect against hash based denial of service attacks. 
    # Defaults to 1000.
    MAX_PARAMETERS: 1000

    # The maximum number of headers that are permitted in a request. 
    # If a client sends more than this number the connection will be closed.

    # Defaults to 200.
    MAX_COOKIES: 200

    # The charset to use to decode the URL and query parameters. 
    # Defaults to UTF-8.
    URL_CHARSET: UTF-8
    
    # If this is true then a Connection: keep-alive header will be added to responses, 
    # even when it is not strictly required by the specification.
    # Defaults to true
    ALWAYS_SET_KEEP_ALIVE: true
    
    # If this is true then a Date header will be added to all responses. 
    # The HTTP spec says this header should be added to all responses, 
    # unless the server does not have an accurate clock.
    # Defaults to true
    ALWAYS_SET_DATE: true
