## RESTHeart Platform Security Configuration File.
---
#### Listeners

 # Listeners allow to specify the protocol, ip, port and to use.
 # The supported protocols are: http, https and ajp.
 # You can setup a listener per protocol (up to 3).

 # WARNING: Using the http listener is not secure with basic authentication:
 # credentials can be sniffed by a man-in-the-middle attack.

https-listener: {{{https-listener}}}
https-host: {{{https-host}}}
https-port: {{{https-port}}}

http-listener: {{{http-listener}}}
http-host: {{{http-host}}}
http-port: {{{http-port}}}

#### Instance name

 # The name of this instance.
 # Displayed in log, also allows to implement instance specific custom code

instance-name: {{{instance-name}}}

### Proxied resources

 # location (required) The location URI to bound to the HTTP proxied server.
 # proxy-pass (required) The URL of the HTTP proxied server. It can be an array of URLs for load balancing.
 # name (optional) The name of the proxy. It is required to identify 'restheart'.
 # rewrite-host-header (optional, default true) should the HOST header be rewritten to use the target host of the call.
 # connections-per-thread (optional, default 10) Controls the number of connections to create per thread.
 # soft-max-connections-per-thread (optional, default 5) Controls the number of connections to create per thread.
 # max-queue-size (optional, default 0) Controls the number of connections to create per thread.
 # connections-ttl (optional, default -1) Connections Time to Live in seconds.
 # problem-server-retry (optional, default 10) Time in seconds between retries for problem server.
proxies:
    - location: /
      proxy-pass: {{{root-proxy-pass}}}
      connections-per-thread: 20
      rewrite-host-header: false
      name: restheart

#### SSL Configuration

 # Configure the keystore to enable the https listener.

 # RESTHeart Security comes with a self-signed certificate that makes
 # straightforward enabling https.
 # Specify use-embedded-keystore: true to use it (this is the default setting).
 # Using the self-signed certificate leads to issues with some clients;
 # for instance, with curl you need to specify the "--insecure" option or you'll get an error message.

use-embedded-keystore: true

 # To use your own certificate you need to import it (and eventually the CA certificates chain) into a java keystore
 # and specify use-embedded-keystore: false and the keystore-file,keystore-password and certpassword configuration properties.
 # Refer to the java keystore documentation for that.

#keystore-file: /path/to/keystore/file
#keystore-password: password
#certpassword: password

### Security

 # RESTHeart Security security is pluggable, you can provide you own
 # implementations of Authenticator Mechanisms, Authenticator, Authorizer
 # and Token Manager

## Authentication Mechanisms

 # As an in-bound request is received the authenticate method is called on each
 # mechanism in turn until one of the following occurs: A mechanism
 # successfully authenticates the incoming request or the list of mechanisms is
 # exhausted.

 # Digest Authentication is disabled by default because it cannot support
 # bcryped stored password (default and more secure preference for rhAuthenticator)
 # Always prefer using basic authetication over TLS

auth-mechanisms:
  tokenBasicAuthMechanism:
    enabled: true
    realm: RESTHeart Realm
  basicAuthMechanism:
    enabled: true
    realm: RESTHeart Realm
    authenticator: rhAuthenticator  
  jwtAuthenticationMechanism:
    enabled: false
    algorithm: HS256
    key: secret
    base64Encoded: false
    usernameClaim: sub
    rolesClaim: roles
    #fixedRoles:
    # - admin
    issuer: myIssuer
    audience: myAudience
  digestAuthMechanism:
    enabled: false
    realm: RESTHeart Realm
    domain: localhost
    authenticator: rhAuthenticator
  identityAuthMechanism:
    enabled: false
    username: admin
    roles:
      - admin
      - user

## Authenticators

 # An Authenticator verify user credential and are used by one or more
 # AuthMachanisms

authenticators:
#    - name: simpleFileAuthenticator
#      class: org.restheart.security.plugins.authenticators.SimpleFileAuthenticator
#      args:
#        conf-file: ../etc/users.yml
    - name: rhAuthenticator
      class: com.restheart.security.plugins.authenticators.RHAuthenticator
      args:
        users-collection-uri: /users
        prop-id: _id
        prop-password: password
        json-path-roles: $.roles
        bcrypt-hashed-password: true
        bcrypt-complexity: 12
        create-user: true
        create-user-document: '{"_id": "admin", "password": "$2a$12$lZiMMNJ6pkyg4uq/I1cF5uxzUbU25aXHtg7W7sD2ED7DG1wzUoo6u", "roles": ["admin"]}'
        # create-user-document.password must be hashed when bcrypt-hashed-password=true
        # default password is 'secret'
        # see https://bcrypt-generator.com but replace initial '$2y' with '$2a'
        cache-enabled: true
        cache-size: 1000
        cache-ttl: 60000
        cache-expire-policy: AFTER_WRITE

## Authorizers

 # Authorizers verify if a request is allowed.

 # As an in-bound request is received and authenticated the isAllowed() method is
 # called on each authenticator in turn until one of the following occurs:
 # an authenticator allows the incoming request or the list of authenticators is
 # exhausted. In the latter case, the request ends and 403 Forbidden is returned.

authorizers:
    - name: rhAuthorizer
      class: com.restheart.security.plugins.authorizers.RHAuthorizer
      args:
        acl-uri: /acl
        root-role: admin
        cache-enabled: true
        cache-size: 1000
        cache-ttl: 5000
        cache-expire-policy: AFTER_WRITE
#    - name: requestPredicatesAuthorizer
#      class: org.restheart.security.plugins.authorizers.RequestPredicatesAuthorizer
#      args:
#        conf-file: ../etc/acl.yml

## Token Manager

 # If a token-manager is configured, RESTHeart Security will use it to generate
 # and verify auth tokens.
 # The token is returned to the caller via auth-token header when the user
 # autheticates succesfully. The token can be used by Authentication Mechanisms.

token-manager:
    name: rndTokenManager
    class: org.restheart.security.plugins.tokens.RndTokenManager
    args:
      ttl: 15
      srv-uri: /tokens

#### Plugins configuration

# The directory containing the plugins jars. 
# The path is either absolute (starts with /) or relative to the restheart.jar file
# Just add the plugins jar to plugins-directory and they will be automatically
# added to the classpath and registered.

plugins-directory: {{{plugins-directory}}}

# All plugins accept the argument 'confArgs'. Set 'confArgs' defining an object
# with the same name of the plugin (as defined in its @RegisterPlugin annotation).
# The property 'enabled' allows enabling plugins that are not enabled by default,
# i.e. that are registered with @RegisterPlugin( .., enabledByDefault=false)

plugins-args:
  rndTokenService:
    uri: /tokens
    secured: false
  ping:
    secured: false
    msg: "{{{ping-hello-message}}}"
  roles:
    uri: /roles
    secured: true

#### Logging

 # enable-log-console: true => log messages to the console (default value: true)
 # enable-log-file: true => log messages to a file (default value: true)
 # log-file-path: to specify the log file path (default value: restheart-security.log in system temporary directory)
 # log-level: to set the log level. Value can be OFF, ERROR, WARN, INFO, DEBUG, TRACE and ALL. (default value is INFO)
 # requests-log-level: log the request-response. 0 => no log, 1 => light log, 2 => detailed dump
 # ansi-console: use Ansi console for logging.
 # WARNING: use requests-log-level level 2 only for development purposes, it logs user credentials (Authorization and Auth-Token headers)
