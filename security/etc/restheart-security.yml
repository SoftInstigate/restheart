## RESTHeart Security Configuration File.
---
#### Listeners

 # Listeners allow to specify the protocol, ip, port and to use.
 # The supported protocols are: http, https and ajp. 
 # You can setup a listener per protocol (up to 3).

 # WARNING: Using the http listener is not secure with basic authentication:
 # credentials can be sniffed by a man-in-the-middle attack.

https-listener: false
https-host: 0.0.0.0
https-port: 4443

http-listener: true
http-host: 0.0.0.0
http-port: 8080

ajp-listener: false
ajp-host: 0.0.0.0
ajp-port: 8009

#### Instance name

 # The name of this instance. 
 # Displayed in log, also allows to implement instance specific custom code

instance-name: default

### Proxied resources

 # location (required) The location URI to bound to the HTTP proxied server.
 # proxy-pass (required) The URL of the HTTP proxied server. It can be an array of URLs for load balancing.
 # name (optional) The name of the proxy. It is required to identify 'restheart'.
 # rewrite-host-header (optional, default true) should the HOST header be rewritten to use the target host of the call.
 # connections-per-thread (optional, default 10) Controls the number of connections to create per thread.
 # soft-max-connections-per-thread (optional, default 5) Controls the number of connections to create per thread.
 # max-queue-size (optional, default 0) Controls the number of connections to create per thread.
 # connections-ttl (optional, default -1) Connections Time to Live in seconds.
 # problem-server-retry (optional, default 10) Time in seconds between retries for problem server.
proxies:
    - location: /
      proxy-pass: ajp://127.0.0.1:8009
      rewrite-host-header: true
      connections-per-thread: 20
      name: restheart

#### SSL Configuration

 # Configure the keystore to enable the https listener.

 # RESTHeart Security comes with a self-signed certificate that makes 
 # straightforward enabling https.
 # Specify use-embedded-keystore: true to use it (this is the default setting).
 # Using the self-signed certificate leads to issues with some clients;
 # for instance, with curl you need to specify the "--insecure" option or you'll get an error message.

use-embedded-keystore: true

 # To use your own certificate you need to import it (and eventually the CA certificates chain) into a java keystore
 # and specify use-embedded-keystore: false and the keystore-file,keystore-password and certpassword configuration properties.
 # Refer to the java keystore documentation for that.

#keystore-file: /path/to/keystore/file
#keystore-password: password
#certpassword: password

### Security

 # RESTHeart Security security is pluggable, you can provide you own 
 # implementations of Authenticator Mechanisms, Authenticator, Authorizer
 # and Token Manager

## Authentication Mechanisms

 # As an in-bound request is received the authenticate method is called on each
 # mechanism in turn until one of the following occurs: A mechanism
 # successfully authenticates the incoming request or the list of mechanisms is
 # exhausted.

 # See README.md for the list of available Authentication Mechanisms

auth-mechanisms:
    - name: tokenBasicAuthMechanism
      class: org.restheart.security.plugins.mechanisms.TokenBasicAuthMechanism
      args: 
        realm: RESTHeart Realm
    - name: basicAuthMechanism
      class:  org.restheart.security.plugins.mechanisms.BasicAuthMechanism
      args:
        realm: RESTHeart Realm
        authenticator: simpleFileAuthenticator
    - name: digestAuthMechanism
      class:  org.restheart.security.plugins.mechanisms.DigestAuthMechanism
      args: 
        realm: RESTHeart Realm
        domain: localhost
        authenticator: simpleFileAuthenticator
#    - name: identityAuthenticationMechanism
#      class: org.restheart.security.plugins.mechanisms.IdentityAuthMechanism
#      args:
#        username: admin
#        roles:
#            - admin
#            - user

## Authenticators

 # An Authenticator verify user credential and are used by one or more 
 # AuthMachanisms

 # See README.md for the list of available Authenticators

authenticators:
    - name: simpleFileAuthenticator
      class: org.restheart.security.plugins.authenticators.SimpleFileAuthenticator
      args:
        conf-file: ../etc/users.yml

## Authorizers

 # An Authorizer is responsible of authorizing the authenticated request
 
 # See README.md for the list of available Authorizers

authorizers:
    name: requestPredicatesAuthorizer
    class: org.restheart.security.plugins.authorizers.RequestPredicatesAuthorizer
    args:
        conf-file: ../etc/acl.yml

## Token Manager

 # If a token-manager is configured, RESTHeart Security will use it to generate 
 # and verify auth tokens.
 # The token is returned to the caller via auth-token header when the user
 # autheticates succesfully. The token can be used by Authentication Mechanisms.

 # See README.md for the list of available Token Managers.

token-manager:
    name: rndTokenManager
    class: org.restheart.security.plugins.tokens.RndTokenManager
    args:
      ttl: 15
      srv-uri: /tokens

## Services

 # RESTHeart Security allows exposing custom services
 # The service class must extend the prg.restheart.security.plugins.Service
 # and can be bound to an URI via the service option

 # See README.md for the list of available Services

services:
    - name: rndTokenService
      class: org.restheart.security.plugins.services.RndTokenService
      uri: /tokens
      secured: false
    - name: ping
      class: org.restheart.security.plugins.services.PingService
      uri: /ping
      secured: false
      args:
          msg: "Hello World!"
    - name: getRoles
      class: org.restheart.security.plugins.services.GetRoleService
      uri: /roles
      secured: true
      args:
          url: /roles
    - name: requestEchoer
      class: org.restheart.security.plugins.services.EchoService
      uri: /echo
      secured: false

#### Plugins configuration

# All plugins accept the argument 'confArgs'. Set 'confArgs' defining an object 
# with the same name of the plugin (as defined in its @RegisterPlugin annotation).
# The property 'enabled' allows enabling plugins that are not enabled by default,
# i.e. that are registered with @RegisterPlugin( .., enabledByDefault=false) 
# NOTE: currently only Initializers are registered with @RegisterPlugin annotation

plugins-args:
  testInitializer:
    enabled: false

#### Logging

 # enable-log-console: true => log messages to the console (default value: true)
 # enable-log-file: true => log messages to a file (default value: true)
 # log-file-path: to specify the log file path (default value: restheart-security.log in system temporary directory)
 # log-level: to set the log level. Value can be OFF, ERROR, WARN, INFO, DEBUG, TRACE and ALL. (default value is INFO)
 # requests-log-level: log the request-response. 0 => no log, 1 => light log, 2 => detailed dump
 # ansi-console: use Ansi console for logging. 
 # WARNING: use requests-log-level level 2 only for development purposes, it logs user credentials (Authorization and Auth-Token headers)

enable-log-file: true
log-file-path: /var/log/restheart-security.log
enable-log-console: true
