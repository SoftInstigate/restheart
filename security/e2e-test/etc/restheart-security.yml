## RESTHeart Security Configuration File.
---
#### Listeners

 # Listeners allow to specify the protocol, ip, port and to use.
 # The supported protocols are: http and https. 
 # You can setup a listener per protocol (up to 3).

 # WARNING: Using the http listener is not secure with basic authentication:
 # credentials can be sniffed by a man-in-the-middle attack.

https-listener: false
https-host: 0.0.0.0
https-port: 4443

http-listener: true
http-host: 0.0.0.0
http-port: 8080

#### Instance name

 # The name of this instance. 
 # Displayed in log, also allows to implement instance specific custom code

instance-name: e2e-test

### Proxied resources

 # location (required) The location URI to bound to the HTTP proxied server.
 # proxy-pass (required) The URL of the HTTP proxied server. It can be an array of URLs for load balancing.
 # name (optional) The name of the proxy. It is required to identify 'restheart'.
 # rewrite-host-header (optional, default true) should the HOST header be rewritten to use the target host of the call.
 # connections-per-thread (optional, default 10) Controls the number of connections to create per thread.
 # soft-max-connections-per-thread (optional, default 5) Controls the number of connections to create per thread.
 # max-queue-size (optional, default 0) Controls the number of connections to create per thread.
 # connections-ttl (optional, default -1) Connections Time to Live in seconds.
 # problem-server-retry (optional, default 10) Time in seconds between retries for problem server.
proxies:
  - location: /
    proxy-pass: ajp://restheart:8009/
    name: restheart

#### SSL Configuration

 # Configure the keystore to enable the https listener.

 # RESTHeart Security comes with a self-signed certificate that makes 
 # straightforward enabling https.
 # Specify use-embedded-keystore: true to use it (this is the default setting).
 # Using the self-signed certificate leads to issues with some clients;
 # for instance, with curl you need to specify the "--insecure" option or you'll get an error message.

use-embedded-keystore: true

 # To use your own certificate you need to import it (and eventually the CA certificates chain) into a java keystore
 # and specify use-embedded-keystore: false and the keystore-file,keystore-password and certpassword configuration properties.
 # Refer to the java keystore documentation for that.

#keystore-file: /path/to/keystore/file
#keystore-password: password
#certpassword: password

### Security

 # RESTHeart Security security is pluggable, you can provide you own 
 # implementations of Authenticator Mechanisms, Authenticator, Authorizer
 # and Token Manager

## Authentication Mechanisms

 # As an in-bound request is received the authenticate method is called on each
 # mechanism in turn until one of the following occurs: A mechanism
 # successfully authenticates the incoming request or the list of mechanisms is
 # exhausted.

 # See README.md for the list of available Authentication Mechanisms

auth-mechanisms:
  tokenBasicAuthMechanism:
    realm: RESTHeart Realm
  basicAuthMechanism:
    realm: RESTHeart Realm
    authenticator: simpleFileAuthenticator

## Authenticators

 # An Authenticator verify user credential and are used by one or more 
 # AuthMachanisms

 # See README.md for the list of available Authenticators

authenticators:
  simpleFileAuthenticator:
    enabled: true
    conf-file: /opt/restheart/etc/users.yml

## Authorizers

 # Authorizers verify if a request is allowed.
     
 # As an in-bound request is received and authenticated the isAllowed() method is 
 # called on each authenticator in turn until one of the following occurs: 
 # an authenticator allows the incoming request or the list of authenticators is 
 # exhausted. In the latter case, the request ends and 403 Forbidden is returned.

 # See README.md for the list of available Authorizers

authorizers:
  requestPredicatesAuthorizer:
    enabled: true
    conf-file: /opt/restheart/etc/acl.yml
  fullAuthorizer:
    enabled: false
    authentication-required: true

## Token Manager

 # If a token-manager is configured, RESTHeart Security will use it to generate 
 # and verify auth tokens.
 # If more than one token-manager are defined, the first one will be used
 # The token is returned to the caller via auth-token header when the user
 # autheticates succesfully. The token can be used by Authentication Mechanisms.

 # See README.md for the list of available Token Managers.

token-manager:
  rndTokenManager:
    enabled: true
    ttl: 15
    srv-uri: /tokens
      
#### Plugins configuration

# The directory containing the plugins jars. 
# The path is either absolute (starts with /) or relative to the restheart.jar file
# Just add the plugins jar to plugins-directory and they will be automatically
# added to the classpath and registered.

plugins-directory: ../plugins

# All plugins accept the argument 'confArgs'. Set 'confArgs' defining an object 
# with the same name of the plugin (as defined in its @RegisterPlugin annotation).
# The property 'enabled' allows enabling plugins that are not enabled by default,
# i.e. that are registered with @RegisterPlugin( .., enabledByDefault=false) 

plugins-args:
  rndTokenService:
    uri: /tokens
    secured: false
  ping:
    secured: false
    msg: {{{ping-hello-message}}}
  roles:
    uri: /roles
    secured: true
  echo:
    uri: /echo
    secured: false

      
#### Logging

 # enable-log-console: true => log messages to the console (default value: true)
 # enable-log-file: true => log messages to a file (default value: true)
 # log-file-path: to specify the log file path (default value: restheart-security.log in system temporary directory)
 # log-level: to set the log level. Value can be OFF, ERROR, WARN, INFO, DEBUG, TRACE and ALL. (default value is INFO)
 # requests-log-level: log the request-response. 0 => no log, 1 => light log, 2 => detailed dump
 # ansi-console: use Ansi console for logging. 
 # WARNING: use requests-log-level level 2 only for development purposes, it logs user credentials (Authorization and Auth-Token headers)

enable-log-file: true
log-file-path: /var/log/restheart-security.log
enable-log-console: true
log-level: DEBUG
requests-log-level: 1
ansi-console: true

 # Limit for the maximum number of concurrent requests being served
requests-limit: 1000

buffer-size: 16384
buffers-per-region: 20
 # Should the buffer pool use direct buffers, this instructs the JVM to use native (if possible) I/O operations on the buffers

  MAX_PARAMETERS: 1000

  # The maximum number of headers that are permitted in a request.
  # If a client sends more than this number the connection will be closed.
